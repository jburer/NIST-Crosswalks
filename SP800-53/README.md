# NIST Crosswalks

Several of the NIST risk, security and privacy documents lend themselves pretty well to a relational data model.
So, to have more flexibility than the PDFs and xlsx NIST puts out, I laid them out *(with some interpretation, mind you)* and imported them.

The single NIST-Crosswalk.db in the Crosswalks folder is stand alone and contains everything.

The original data (in CSV format) for each is located in the corresponding folder.  In addition the SQL DDL is included in the Crosswalks folder, which includes various views.
