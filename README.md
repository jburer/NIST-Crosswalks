# NIST Crosswalks

Several of the NIST risk, security and privacy documents lend themselves pretty well to a relational data model.
So, to have more flexibility than the PDFs and xlsx NIST puts out, I laid them out *(with some interpretation, mind you)* and imported them.

The original data (in CSV format) for each is located in the corresponding folder.  Each is imported as its own table in the single DB.  
The SQL DDL is included, which includes various views.
