# NIST Crosswalks

Several of the NIST risk, security and privacy publications lend themselves *(pretty well)* to a relational data model.
So, to have more flexibility than the PDFs and xlsx NIST puts out, I laid them out *(with some interpretation, mind you)* and imported them.

The single NIST-Crosswalk.db is stand alone and contains everything.  In addition the SQL DDL is included, which includes various views.

The original data (in CSV format) for each is located in the corresponding folders inside the data folder.
