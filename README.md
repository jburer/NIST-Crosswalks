# NIST Crosswalks

Several of the NIST risk, security and privacy publications lend themselves *- pretty well -* to a relational data model.
So, to have more flexibility than the PDFs and xlsx NIST puts out, I laid them out *- with some interpretation, mind you -* and imported them.

The single NIST-Crosswalk.db is stand alone SQLite DB and contains everything.  

The SQL DDL and the original data (in CSV format, located in the corresponding folders) is included, which also includes various views.
