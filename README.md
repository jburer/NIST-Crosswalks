# NIST Crosswalks

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and Security and Privacy Controls (SP 800-53 Rev. 4) lend themselves pretty well to a relational data model.
So, to have more flexibility than the xlsx NIST puts out, I laid them out *(with some interpretation, mind you)* and imported them.


## Security and Privacy Controls SP 800-53 (Rev. 4)

An individual DB is available just for SP 800-53 (Rev. 4).  Included are the SQL queries and original data.  (These are the source for the top level DB.)
